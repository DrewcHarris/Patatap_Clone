# Patatap Clone

## Introduction

This is one of the projects built during [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) that mimics some of the aspects from [patatap.com](http://www.patatap.com/).  Each key press emits a different sound and a visual effect appears on the screen.  For this project, only circles were implemented.
